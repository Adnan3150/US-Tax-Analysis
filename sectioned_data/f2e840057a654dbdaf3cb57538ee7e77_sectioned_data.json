The Submission ID assigned to your extension\nis\nDO NOT SEND A PAPER COPY OF YOUR RETURN TO THE IRS.\nIF YOU DO, IT WILL DELAY THE PROCESSING OF THE RETURN.\nIf You Need to Make a Change to Your Return\nIf you need to make a change or correct the return you filed electronically, you should send a Form 1040X, Amended U.S.\nIndividual Income Tax Return, to the IRS Submission Processing Center that processes paper returns for your area. The\naddress is available at www.irs.gov, or you can call the IRS toll-free at 1-800-829-1040.\nIf You Need to Ask About Your Refund\nThe IRS notifies your Electronic Return Originator (ERO) when your return is accepted, usually within 48 hours. If your\nreturn was not accepted, the IRS notifies your ERO of the reasons for rejection. If it has been more than three weeks\nsince the IRS accepted your return and you have not received your refund, go to www.irs.gov and click on \"Where's My\nRefund?\" to view your refund status. Exception: If box 3 above is checked, allow 4 to 6 weeks for processing of your\nreturn. A notice will be sent to you advising of changes to your return.\nAlso, you can call the TeleTax line at 1-800-829-4477, for automated refund information. You should have available the\nfirst social security number shown on your return, your filing status, and the exact amount of the refund you expect.\nTeleTax gives you the date for mailing or depositing your refund. You should receive your refund check within 30 days of\nthe date given by TeleTax, or within one week of that date, if you chose direct deposit. If you do not receive it by then, or if\nTeleTax does not give your refund information, call the Refund Hotline at 1-800-829-1954.\nEEA                    www.irs.gov                    Form 9325 (Rev. 1-2017)\n\n=== PAGE 3 ===\nThe IRS uses refunds to cover overdue taxes and notifies you when this occurs. The Fiscal Service offsets refunds\nthrough the Treasury Offset Program to cover past due child support, federal agency non-tax debts such as student loans\nand state income tax obligations. Fiscal Service sends you an offset notice if it applies your refund or part of your refund\nto non-tax debts. If you have questions about the offset, contact the agency identified in the notice. You may also call the\nTreasury Offset Program Call Center at 1-800-304-3107, if you have additional questions.\nIf You Owe Tax\nIf your return has a balance due, you must pay the amount you owe by the prescribed due date. If you paid by electronic\nfunds withdrawal (direct debit) or by credit card, no voucher is needed. The credit card service providers will charge a\nconvenience fee based on the amount of taxes you are paying. The fees and the type of credit or debit cards accepted\nmay vary between providers. You will be told the amount of the fee during the transaction and you will be given the option\nto either continue or end the transaction. For information on paying your taxes electronically, including by credit or debit\ncard, go to www.irs.gov/e-pay.\nIf you are not paying electronically you may use Form 1040-V, Payment Voucher, which you can obtain from your\nElectronic Return Originator. If the IRS does not receive your payment by the prescribed due date, you will receive a\nnotice that requests full payment of the tax due, plus penalties and interest. If you can not pay the amount in full, complete\nForm 9465, Installment Agreement Request, which you may file electronically. To apply for an installment agreement\nonline, go to www.irs.gov. You may also order Form 9465 by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676). If approved, the\nIRS charges a user fee to set up an installment agreement.\nIf You Need to Inquire About Your Electronic Funds Withdrawal Payment\nYou may call 1-888-353-4537 to inquire about the status of your electronic funds withdrawal payment. If there is a change\nto the bank account information included on your return, you should call this number to cancel a scheduled payment. You\nshould have available the social security number of the first person listed on the tax return, the payment amount, and the\nbank account number. Cancellation requests must be received no later than 11:59 p.m. E.T. two business days prior to\nthe scheduled payment date.\nTax Refund Related Financial Products\nFinancial institutions offer a variety of financial products to taxpayers based on their refunds. Contracts for financial\nproducts are between you and the financial institution. The IRS is not associated with the contract. If you have questions\nabout tax refund related products, contact your Electronic Return Originator or the lender.\nInstructions for Electronic Return Originators\nLine 2 PIN Presence Indicator - Check box 2 if the taxpayer entered a PIN or authorized the ERO to enter or generate\nthe PIN for the taxpayer, and the Acknowledgement File PIN Presence Indicator is a \"Practitioner PIN,\" \"Self-Select PIN\"\nor \"Online Filer PIN.\" Form 8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization, is required if the ERO enters or generates the PIN or\nif the Practitioner PIN method is used.
